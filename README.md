# Student Management System using Java 
Was Created in Sem 4 2022

This project is a simple student management system implemented in Java. It allows users to enroll students, assign courses, view tuition balance, and make payments.

## Code Structure

### Student Class (Code 1)

The Student class represents a student entity with properties such as first name, last name, grade year, student ID, enrolled courses, and tuition balance. It includes methods for enrolling in courses, viewing the balance, making payments, and generating a string representation of the student.

### StudentDatabaseApp Class (Code 2)

The StudentDatabaseApp class contains the main method for running the student management system. It prompts the user to input the number of new students to enroll, creates an array of Student objects based on the input, enrolls each student, collects tuition payments, and displays student information.

## Usage

To use this student management system:

1. Compile both Student.java and StudentDatabaseApp.java.
2. Run StudentDatabaseApp to start the program.
3. Follow the prompts to enroll students, assign courses, and make payments.
